BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.

Dated this the 19" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to
quash all proceedings against them.

2. Petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.1064 of 2023 of
Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha, registered for the offences under
Sections 294(b), 341, 323, 324, 394 and 506 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860. The 2" respondent is the defacto complainant.

3. According to the prosecution, on 11.11.2023, the accused had
assaulted the defacto complainant and took away an amount of Rs.7,500/- and
food packets from the defacto complainant after abusing him and thereby
committed the offences alleged.

4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel
for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter has
been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be
quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged,
no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings.

6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC
303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take
note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the

wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in

CRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024
4
Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC
466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another
[(2014) 9 SCC 653].

7. I have perused Annexure-A2 affidavit filed by the 2" respondent. The
learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood
that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contents
thereof. I am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is
involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for
quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.

8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the _ petitioners in
Crime No.1064 of 2023 of Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha are quashed.

This Crl.M.C is allowed as above.
