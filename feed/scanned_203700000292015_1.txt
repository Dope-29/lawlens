ORDER

The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C.
No.1007/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,
Manjeri. The crime in this case was registered under Sections
323,324 & 341 of I.P.C. on the complaint of one Nazar. The
petitioner now seeks orders quashing the prosecution on the
ground that he and the de facto complainant Nazar have come
to terms amicably out of Court. The de facto complainant is
the first respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit
to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the accused,
and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that continuance
of the prosecution in such a situation will not serve any
purpose other than wasting the precious time of the Court.
Nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial.

In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. The prosecution

against the petitioner in C.C. No. 1007/2013 of the Judicial
