ORDER

Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.1044/2020 of the
Ernakulam Central Police Station, now pending as
C.C.No.1205/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-II, Ernakulam, for the offences punishable
under Section 323, 324 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860.

2. According to the prosecution, on 01.07.2020 the first petitioner
threw a cement block on the leg of the son of the de facto
complainant, while the 2" petitioner kicked him and thereby
committed the offences alleged.

3. Sri.D.G.Vipin, the learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted
that the complaint has been filed with mala fides and solely to
wreak vengeance due to a civil dispute pending between the
parties. It was further submitted that O.S.No.206/2018 filed by

the the 2" petitioner against the de facto complainant is

3

pending and that the present complaint has been initiated only
to compel the petitioners to settle the said civil dispute. It was
further submitted that the entire prosecution allegations are
false and that, none of the offences are even made out.

4. Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor, submitted that the
nature of the allegations in the final report reveals that the
same is a matter for trial.

5. On a perusal of the final report as well as the statement
produced along with it, this Court notices that there are factual
allegations, which require appreciation of facts. The remedy
under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be involved in such an
instance.

6. Apart from the above, the petitioner has remedies available
under the Cr.P.C., to seek discharge from the offences alleged.
Recourse to the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. ought to
be availed of only in exceptional circumstances where the
materials collected by the investigating officer, even if admitted,
would not make out an offence as alleged or when there are

proved mala fides.

7. As observed above, a perusal of the allegations in the final
report and the records will reveal that such a remedy under
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is not available to the petitioners.
Therefore, I find no merit in the Crl.M.C. and the same is
dismissed.

8. However, the dismissal of this Crl.M.C. shall not stand in the
way of the petitioners taking recourse to other remedies

available under law.
