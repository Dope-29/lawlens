P.BHAVADASAN, J.

Dated this the 02™ day of January, 2014

ORDER

This is a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.
seeking to have all further proceedings in Crime No. 3128 of
2013 of Chalakkudy Police Station quashed.

2. The petitioner stands accused of having
committed the offence punishable under Section 379 read
with Section 34 of IPC.

3. It is unnecessary to go into the facts and details of
the case for the simple reason that the petitioners have
impleaded the defacto complaint/victim as the second
respondent who has entered appearance through a counsel
and the learned counsel appearing for the second
respondent has accepted that the Annexure-ll affidavit filed
along with this petition is one sworn to by the defacto
complainant herself and she stands by the statements

contained therein.

On going through Annexure-ll affidavit, it is seen that
the parties have settled all their differences and issues
between them and no further grievance remains to be
resolved between the victim and the accused. It is pointed
out that the victim is disinterested in continuing the matter.
In the light of the statement made in the affidavit, it is felt
that continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise
in futility.

In the result, this petition is allowed. All further
proceedings in Crime No. 3128 of 2013 of Chalakkudy Police
Station including the FIR shall stand quashed and the
petitioner shall stand discharged and all further proceedings

shall stand dropped.
