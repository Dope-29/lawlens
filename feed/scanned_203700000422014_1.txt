ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in S.C.No. 922/2013 of Additional
Sessions Court No.V of Kollam. Annexure A is the copy of the
order dated 13.11.2013 in Crl.M.P.No. 3336/2013 of Sessions
Court, Kollam. As per Annexure A, learned Judge granted bail
subject to conditions. Subsequently, the court issued show cause
notice dated 25.11.2013 directing the petitioner to show cause
within seven days from receipt of the notice as to why bail shall
not be cancelled. Annexure B is the copy of the show cause
notice. The reason stated for issuing show cause notice is that
while filing Crl.M.P.No. 3336/2013 on 11.11.13 the fact that bail
application filed by the petitioner was dismissed by this Court on
8.11.13 was not mentioned that it was concealed from the court
below and that it is seen that bail was obtained from the court
below by playing fraud. Annexure C is the affidavit filed by the
petitioner dated 29.11.2013 explaining the circumstance under
which the Crl.M.P.No. 3336/2013 was filed.

2. In the facts and circumstance, there will be a direction to

the Additional District and Sessions Judge-V, Kollam to consider
