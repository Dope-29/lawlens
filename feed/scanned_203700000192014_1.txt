ORDER

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and respondents.

Police Station now pending as C.C.No.575/2013 before the Judicial
First Class Magistrate Court-VI, Kozhikode are the petitioners. The
petition is filed seeking to quash further proceedings against the
petitioners in C.C.No.575/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class
Magistrate Court-VI, Kozhikode.

3. The offences alleged are punishable under Sections 341,
