Dated this the 5" day of January, 2024

ORDER

Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.643/2018 of Ernakulam
Central Police Station, now pending as C.C.No.1630/2018 on
the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,
Ernakulam.

2. Prosecution allegation is that, on 04.03.2018 at about 9.30 a.m,
while the de facto complainant was distributing certain
pamphlets to enforce the Church Act in front of St.Mary’s
Basilica, the accused came in a bike and assaulted him after
being wrongfully restrained, and thereby committed the
offences under Section 341 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code,
1860.

3. Sri.Sabu Pullan, the learned counsel for the petitioner,
submitted that the entire prosecution allegations are false and

no materials have been collected to implicate the petitioner in

the manner alleged. It was further submitted that the incident
is alleged to have occurred on 04.03.2018, while the complaint
was lodged on 05.03.2018 and the final report was submitted
on 06.03.2018, which clearly indicates the hasty manner in
which the investigation was conducted. It was also submitted
that the allegations do not make out any of the offences

alleged.

4. I have heard Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor as

well.

5. On a perusal of the final report produced as Annexure III, it is
evident that the allegations prima facie make out the offenses
alleged. However, if the petitioner believes that the evidence
collected by the investigating officer is not sufficient to
implicate him as an accused, the remedy is not by a petition
under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Recourse to the remedies under
Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. can only be in_ exceptional
circumstances, where even if the allegations are admitted the
same do not make out any of the offenses alleged. Such a

situation does not arise in this case, since it is specifically

stated that the de facto complainant was wrongfully restrained
and assaulted by the accused while distributing the pamphlets

relating to enforcement of Church Act.

6. Since the ingredients of the offences are prima facie made out
from the allegations, I am of the view that a case under
Section 482 of Cr.P.C. has not been made out. Accordingly, I

dismiss this Crl.M.C.
