Crl.MC.No.71 OF 2020 (H) AUIRERIOS?

ORDER

Dated this the 8th day of January, 2020

The petitioners were released on bail by the Sessions
Court, Ernakulam on condition that they shall appear before the
Investigating Officer on every Saturday between 9.00 a.m and

10.00 a.m.

2. Subsequently, the petitioners had approached this Court
for quashing of the proceedings and vide order at Annexure â€” A5, it
was directed by this Court that the investigation could continue.
But the final report has to be filed after seeking permission of this

Court.

3. Subsequently, the petitioners had approached the
Sessions Court for modification of the direction regarding the
appearance before the Investigating Officer on every Saturday.
The order was modified to the effect that they shall appear before
the Investigating Officer on every second Saturday. That order at

Annexure A-6 is challenged before this Court.

Crl.MC.No.71 OF 2020(H) aUURERIGS?
3
Considering the facts that the final report has to be filed
only after getting permission of this Court, I find that the direction
to appear before the Investigating Officer on every second
Saturday is not very relevant and necessary. The petitioners shall

appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for.

The impugned order is modified to that effect.
The Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.
